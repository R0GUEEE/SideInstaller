# Changelog

All notable changes to SideInstaller are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Changed
- **Injection frameworks live in Tweak storage now.** The loader list — ElleKit, Substitute,
  CydiaSubstrate, libhooker, with download / add-from-file / remove — moved out of the install
  menu's tweak section into **Tools › Tweak storage**, beside the libraries they load. A loader is
  part of the toolkit, not part of one build, so adding it once serves every install that needs it.
- **The tweak section has path and folder selectors.** Two menus under **Tweaks** choose how an
  injected library is named — `@executable_path` or `@rpath` — and where it's copied —
  `/Frameworks/` or `/` — defaulting to `@executable_path` and `/Frameworks/`. Changing either
  rewrites the load path of every tweak already added, so the list and the load commands stay in
  step instead of drifting.
- **Adding a tweak sets it up the way injection expects.** Every injected library is loaded from
  `@executable_path/Frameworks/<library>` — the folder the build actually gets — and treated as
  optional (`LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`) by default, for `.dylib` files and `.deb` packages alike; a
  package's load path now names the library inside it rather than the package file. Adding a tweak
  also fetches the injection framework it depends on when that framework is published (ElleKit,
  Substitute); the closed ones still have to be added by hand.
- **Downloads reads as a list of apps, compactly.** Each row shows the app's own name — read from the
  `.ipa`'s `Info.plist`, so a file downloaded as `com.burbn.instagram.ipa` reads Instagram — with its
  size and date on one line, and **Configure** and **Install** at the end of the row instead of a
  second line of buttons. A search field sits at the top of the page, filtering by app name or file
  name; share and delete moved into each row's menu.

### Changed
- **A marketplace download lands in the install menu instead of installing itself.** Both the row's
  download button and the app page's primary button now fetch the release and hand it to the Install
  tab as the custom build, so its name, capabilities and tweaks can be set before signing. The
  install-all-updates path is unchanged; it still installs what it finds.
- **Downloads: a library of the `.ipa` files on this iPhone.** The icon at the trailing end of the
  marketplace's search bar opens it — everything downloaded or imported, with **Configure** (hand it
  to the install menu) and **Install** (sign and install now) per file, share and delete.
- **My Apps opens with the title above the search field.** The field was `.searchable`, which lives
  in the navigation bar, so the header sat below it with a gap; it's a field in the page now, under
  the header and directly above the list. Rows also fall back to the source's icon artwork when the
  device's own icon hasn't been read yet, instead of showing a letter.
- **Marketplace rows are all the same length.** The per-row version menu is always present (disabled
  for a single release) instead of making rows with several releases wider than the rest.

### Added
- **Free in-app purchases, as one switch in the tweak section.** Signing configuration › Tweaks now
  carries a **Free in-app purchases** toggle that adds the three bundled patches together:
  **SatellaJailed** (hooks StoreKit's receipt and transaction checks with its own runtime),
  **iOSGods iAPCracker** (drives `SKPaymentTransaction.transactionState` to purchased through
  `MSHookMessageEx`) and **autoRevenuecat** (answers RevenueCat as if every entitlement is active).
  The Logos tweak is marked as needing an injection framework — ElleKit/Substitute/Substrate/
  libhooker, whichever is already here — and the panel offers to download ElleKit when none is.
  Turning the switch off removes all three. The libraries are bundled in the app
  (`IAPTweaks/`), so nothing has to be fetched.

### Added
- **Bulk install.** Under the custom `.ipa` button, **Bulk install** takes several files at once and
  puts them in the install queue, one after another — the queue card on the Install tab shows each
  one's state. A picker's file stops being readable when the picker closes, so each is copied into
  the app's own staging folder first, and the copies are pruned once their item leaves the queue.
- **The signing configuration is filled in from the build.** Picking an `.ipa` now reads its
  `Info.plist` and entitlements (off the main actor) and seeds the panel: app name, bundle ID,
  version and build, and the capability switches it already declares — document browser, background
  audio and location, increased memory, Wi-Fi info. Only what the panel can express is taken; the
  build's whole plist would be hundreds of keys, and its entitlements are re-issued by the profile.
- **The configuration is cleared when a run ends**, successful or not: identity, plist and
  entitlement edits, capabilities and the injected tweak copies. The next install starts from its
  own build instead of inheriting the last app's name, entitlements and tweaks. Injectors stay (a
  framework isn't part of one app), and Tweak storage keeps its own copies, so a set can be applied
  again in one tap.

### Added
- **Tweak storage (Tools › Tweak storage).** A place for tweaks that aren't in a build yet: `.dylib`
  files and `.deb` packages, kept in `Application Support/TweakLibrary`, plus **bundles** — named
  sets of them — so "my setup" can be added to a build in one tap. Applying an item copies it into
  the app configuration, the same path a picked file takes.

### Changed
- **My Apps is a list again.** The top of the page was a stack of page-wide buttons; now it opens on
  the apps. **Updates** moved behind a download icon in the toolbar with the count beside it, and
  the sheet it opens lists each newer release with the app's icon, its old and new version, and an
  install button per row plus one for all of them. **Reload** is a toolbar icon (it becomes the way
  to cancel a run), and **Refresh all** sits under the list with its caption, where it belongs after
  you've seen what needs it. Icons now fill from the disk cache as soon as the page appears, so a
  restored list doesn't sit on placeholder squares.
- **The install menu is rebuilt around an advanced install.** The build presets are a dropdown with
  the **version selector beside it**, the **custom `.ipa`** is a button of its own underneath, and
  everything that shapes the signed build is in one expandable **Signing configuration**: app name
  and bundle ID, Info.plist and entitlement editors, **capability switches** (document browser,
  background audio and location, increased memory limit, Wi-Fi info), frameworks and dylibs
  (with the tweak storage and the browser beside them), the tweaks already added — and the
  **injection frameworks**, with ElleKit/Substitute downloadable and CydiaSubstrate/libhooker added
  from a file, plus a warning naming whatever an added tweak needs.

### Changed
- **The action buttons are one size again.** The shared primary button dropped from a 52-point slab
  (headline, 16pt of air, 18-point corners) to a 40-point row: `subheadline` semibold, 12 points of
  padding, 14-point corners and a tighter glow — and with it every screen that uses it (Refresh all,
  Load apps, Pair across iPhones, Sign in, and the rest). A new **secondary** style shares those
  measurements, so a primary and secondary action side by side are the same height; the first place
  that needed it was the "did you get it from sideinstaller.net" pair. The Install tab's own button
  keeps its size, since it reshapes into the run's progress card rather than sitting in a row.

### Changed
- **Install, My Apps and Tools open with a compact header.** The big hero — an 86-point glyph over
  a large title with the status pill under it — gave way to a single row: a 34-point glyph beside a
  `title3` title, the status pill tucked under, about 70 points tall instead of 140. On the three
  tabs that open with a list, that's a card's worth of content visible without scrolling. Every
  other page keeps the hero it had.

### Changed
- **Settings is part of the Tools tab.** The gear in the top-right corner of every screen is gone;
  the page it opened is the first card of **Tools** now, above the search field, and still opens as
  a sheet with the same **Done**. Its sub-pages (Account, Tunnel, Renewals, Storage, Telegram,
  Marketplace, Activity log) are reached from there. Pages that used to offer the gear — Install,
  Marketplace, My Apps, Certificates, Entitlements, Pairing, Location, Side by Side, Install
  history, Stored builds, Inspect .ipa, Injected libraries, Tweak browser, About — simply don't any
  more; there is one way in, and it's on a page whose job is the app's own controls.

### Fixed
- **The Tools pages no longer do their heavy work while drawing.** Device info measured the app
  container — a walk of every file in it, documents and caches included — inside a `body`, so the
  page stalled for as long as the walk took and re-ran it on every redraw; Stored builds re-scanned
  its folder for the header on each redraw; Install history checked for a file once per row per
  redraw (two hundred file tests on a full list); Report a problem rebuilt the whole redacted log on
  every keystroke in its description field. All of that is measured once — off the main actor, with
  a visible "Measuring…" while it runs — and the Reports page's report is built once.
- **Injected libraries reads an executable's head instead of the whole binary.** The page inflated
  each stored build's executable in full (tens of megabytes apiece, up to a gigabyte for a big app)
  to read load commands that live in the first few kilobytes. It now reads an 8 MB prefix, refuses
  members over 64 MB compressed, and says "the executable couldn't be read" rather than claiming
  the build links nothing.
- **Long lists build lazily.** Entitlements (hundreds of App IDs on a paid team) and the tweak
  browser's results are `LazyVStack`s now.
- **Smaller ones:** the certificate expiry is parsed with shared ISO-8601 formatters instead of a
  new one per call, the Tools hub formats that expiry once per change instead of once per redraw,
  Settings › Storage measures its four folders off the main actor, and the About page's QR code is
  rendered once, off the main actor.

### Changed
- **The Tools tab is grouped, searchable, and says what's in each page.** Thirteen pages now sit in
  five sections — Device, Signing, Apps & builds, Sources & tweaks, Help — with a search field over
  all of them, and each row carries its own status: the signing certificate's expiry (in orange when
  it's close), how many builds are recorded, how much sits in Stored builds, how many sources and
  repositories are configured, the app's version. **Marketplace sources**, **Report a problem** and
  **About** are reachable from here now instead of only through Settings or a sheet inside another
  page.

### Changed
- **The install menu is the whole setup, above the Install button.** The build is now four cards
  (SideStore, SideStore + LiveContainer, Madeira, Custom .ipa) instead of a dropdown, and what the
  install carries is a row of chips that say what they're set to: **Version** (the release, as a list
  with room for a maintainer's warning), **Configuration** (how many changes the custom `.ipa` will
  get), and **Pairing** (automatic, or the file you imported). The old collapsed **Advanced** section
  under the button is gone; nothing an install needs is behind a disclosure any more.

### Added
- **Tweaks know what they are, and when there's a newer one.** A package added from a repository —
  or a `.deb` picked in Files — now records its package identifier, version and where it came from.
  The tweak list shows `1.4 · havoc.app`, and when a repository has a newer release its row offers
  **Update to 1.6**: the build downloads and replaces the old one in place, keeping the "optional"
  choice. The browser marks every package as new, up to date or updatable, and a package's page says
  which version is installed before you tap.
- **Adding a package replaces its earlier build** rather than loading two copies of one tweak. A
  tweak added before this change has no version on record, so it's shown but never offered an
  update it can't compare.

### Added
- **A tweak browser.** **App configuration › Tweaks & injectors › Browse** (also **Tools › Tweak
  browser**) reads any Sileo/Cydia repository — Havoc and Chariz are there to start with — and adds a
  package straight to the configuration: search by name, identifier, developer or section, tap a
  package for its description and dependencies, and its `.deb` is downloaded once and handed to the
  same path a picked file takes. Indexes are cached, so the page opens offline and says when a
  refresh failed; a package's SHA-256 is checked against the index when it publishes one.

### Added
- **Quality-of-life pass:**
  - **My Apps has a search field** (name, bundle ID or App ID) and a sort toggle between expiry and
    name, so a device with forty sideloaded apps is navigable.
  - **Haptics** where they belong: a success tap when a run finishes installing, a warning when it
    stops, a firm tap when you confirm an uninstall — and none for background work.
  - **Copy and share from the Info sheet**: copy the bundle ID in one tap, or copy/share a text
    summary of the app (name, IDs, version, signer, expiry, and whether a stored `.ipa` exists) —
    which is exactly what a bug report needs.
  - **An .ipa opened from another app** (share sheet, "Open with") now imports *and* lands you on the
    Install tab, where it's ready, instead of silently importing behind the current screen.

### Changed
- **Installs finish on their own.** The "this app needs an App ID" stop before signing is off by
  default; the run logs what it registers and carries on to installation. Settings › Renewals ›
  Installing turns the prompt back on for anyone who wants the confirmation.
- **My Apps can update as well as re-sign.** Each app's menu is now *Update or reinstall*: from the
  stored `.ipa`, straight to a newer release when a source carries one, or — always available — a
  search of the marketplace for that bundle ID. A card above the list offers **Install all updates**
  when several are waiting, one at a time so they share the device link politely.
- **The marketplace knows what's installed.** An app's page shows the version on the device and says
  when the release you're looking at is newer, so "should I update?" is answered before you tap.

### Added
- **Installed builds are kept, so they can be re-signed later.** Every `.ipa` SideInstaller installs
  is copied into `Application Support/IPACache`, keyed by bundle ID — the signed bundle on the device
  can't be pulled back, and the original download is often gone by the time the seven days run out.
  The cache is part of the IPA library, so **My Apps › Re-sign** now works for anything installed
  here. It prunes itself: copies older than sixty days, and the oldest once it passes 2 GB.
- **Two more tools.** **Stored builds** lists what's cached — install it again, share it, or delete
  the copy (the app stays installed). **Device** reads the model, iOS build, UDID, free/total storage
  and the app container's size, with a button to re-read them from the device.

### Added
- **Renewals: re-signing apps before they expire.** Settings › Renewals switches on a background pass
  (`BGAppRefreshTask`) that finds sideloaded apps whose profile expires within a configurable window
  (6–72 hours, default 24), re-signs the ones whose `.ipa` is still on the device, and posts a
  notification with the result. A background pass can't answer a 2FA prompt, so a sign-in that needs
  a code stops the pass and says to open the app. There's a **Renew expiring apps now** button for
  the same work on demand.

### Fixed
- **The source store mutated published state from whatever context called it.** Every method that
  touches it is now main-actor bound.
- **The local server rewrote the generated source on every request** — including each page load's
  JSON fetch. It's cached for five seconds now.
- **A deliberate refresh ignored its own `force` flag** and still sent `If-None-Match`; it now asks
  for the body, so Refresh really refetches.
- **Changing "show entries that open another app" in Settings had no effect** until the next source
  revision. The marketplace observes it.
- **A renewal pass signed in once per app**, inside the loop. It signs in once, before it.
- **A scan blanked the results list while it ran**, and the renewals row did profile matching inside
  a SwiftUI body. Both fixed.

### Added
- **Settings, properly.** New sections and screens, all driving real behaviour rather than
  describing it:
  - **Sources & storage › Telegram channels** — use the RSS bridge (off means preview-off channels
    can't be read at all), scan on launch, every-page limit (5–100 pages), default depth for a new
    channel, background refresh and the post-background grace period, local server auto-start, port
    and live state.
  - **Marketplace** — the order it opens with (name/newest/oldest/size, kept in sync with the menu),
    and whether entries that only open another app (Telegram posts) are listed.
  - **Storage** — each regenerable cache (source indexes, source documents, app icons, generated
    sources) with its size and a way to clear it, and the total. Your .ipa library, pairing files and
    certificates aren't in the list and can't be cleared from it.
  - **Diagnostics** — exports a text file with the settings, storage report, source states, channels
    and the last 300 log lines (no Apple ID, no passwords), and resets these settings without touching
    accounts, certificates or sources.

### Added
- **App configuration is in Settings too.** A row there opens the same toolkit the Install screen does,
  with the number of pending changes on it — identity, `Info.plist` keys, entitlements, extensions,
  tweaks and injectors, import/export and reset.
- **A tweak's load path is editable.** A library built for `@rpath`, or one that lives in a framework,
  no longer has to sit at `@executable_path/Frameworks/<name>`.
- **Check against the build.** One tap compares every key and entitlement you set with what the `.ipa`
  actually contains and reports what changes, what's added, what's already true and what can't be a
  plist value — before an install rather than after.

### Changed
- **Telegram channels scan every page by default.** The per-channel depth is now a switch —
  *Scan every page*, on unless you turn it off — with a forty-page backstop (about eight hundred
  posts) that stops early when a page brings nothing new.
- **Icons everywhere.** Every Telegram entry carries a picture: the bridge's per-item preview image
  when there is one, otherwise the channel's own icon (from the feed, or the preview page's
  `og:image`). Channel rows in the studio show it too, instead of a generic glyph.
- **The bridge feed is asked for more, and survives being busy.** `?limit=100` returns ~99 items
  instead of ten; a 500 (it does that under load) is retried once and then falls back to the plain
  feed, so a channel is never lost to a transient error.

### Added
- **A workaround for channels without web previews.** A public RSS bridge
  (`tg.i-c-a.su`) republishes a channel with `<enclosure>` links to the files themselves, so those
  channels now list *and download*. Measured: `blatants` 5 files, `binnichtaktivsipas` 5,
  `iOS_Randy420` 1, `ipaomtk` 10 — all previously unreadable or post-only. The channel reader tries
  the bridge and the preview and merges them: bridge links install directly, preview posts stay
  current.
- **A channel directory** replaces the free-text box: groups you can open, each channel with what it
  carries and an Add button, plus the paste field for anything else.
- **`/analyze` and `/analyze.json`** on the local server: the first renders every channel's apps as a
  page a webview can load (app, version, size, and a link that either downloads or opens Telegram);
  the second is the same as JSON.
- **Background refreshes** via `BGAppRefreshTask`, plus a ~30-second `beginBackgroundTask` grace
  period after backgrounding so a client can finish a fetch.

### Note
- **Silent audio and location keep-alive were not implemented.** Both are background-mode abuse —
  they declare a purpose the app doesn't have, drain the battery, and are exactly what gets a
  signing certificate pulled. The refresh + grace period is the honest ceiling iOS offers.

### Added
- **A local server for the Telegram source.** Sources › Telegram channels › **Local server** starts an
  HTTP server bound to `127.0.0.1` only, serving `/telegram-source.json` (rebuilt on every request),
  `/health` and a status page. That URL can be added as a source by anything on the same iPhone —
  SideStore and AltStore included — so the generated list works as a live URL rather than a file.

### Note
- **An api_id/api_hash isn't a login.** It identifies an application to Telegram; reading *your*
  joined channels needs an MTProto session for your account, which this build doesn't have. The
  server serves what the studio can produce — public previews, imported exports, direct `.ipa` links
  — and says so on its index page. iOS also stops the socket when the app leaves the foreground.

### Added
- **Telegram API credentials, set up in three steps.** Sources › Telegram channels ›
  **Set up API credentials** links straight to my.telegram.org/apps, takes the api_id and api_hash
  Telegram issues for an app, checks their shape, and keeps them in the Keychain. They're what any
  Telegram client needs before it can log in.
- **Import a channel export.** Telegram Desktop › a channel › ⋮ › Export chat history › JSON: pick
  its `result.json` and every `.ipa` it lists joins the studio — and any file that came with the
  export **installs straight from disk**, no account and no preview needed. That's the offline path
  to a channel whose previews are off.

### Note
- **The login itself is still the MTProto client's job.** Credentials get a client to the door; the
  session (code, 2FA, key on device) is a separate piece of work and the screen says so rather than
  pretending the account is connected.

### Added
- **A Telegram studio** (Sources › Telegram channels): pick the channels to watch, set how far back to
  scan (each preview page is about twenty posts), scan them, and turn the result into an
  AltStore-format source at `Documents/Telegram/telegram-source.json` — loadable by the app through
  a `file://` URL, or copyable as JSON to host anywhere for SideStore or AltStore.
- **Deep channel scans.** The preview paginates with `?before=<oldest id>`, so a channel is read
  several pages back instead of only its twenty most recent posts.

### Note
- **No Telegram login.** Reading a channel as your account needs an MTProto session — an api_id and
  api_hash, a phone login with its code and 2FA, and a session key on the device. The studio says so
  on its account card rather than offering a button that can't work; what ships reads public
  previews, which is what the scan and the generated source are built on.

### Added
- **Telegram channels, the ones you asked for.** `ipaomtk` is listed with its app write-ups; `ipahub`
  with its attachments; `binnichtaktivsipas`, `blatants` and `iOS_Randy420` say plainly that their
  previews are off and offer **Open in Telegram** (`t.me/c/…` links are private and refused with a
  reason). A post with no attachment but a title and a link — how catalogue channels post — is
  listed as an app that opens its page.
- **Telegram channels as sources.** Add `t.me/<channel>` under Sources and its `.ipa` posts appear in
  the marketplace beside everything else, with the file's name, size and date. Telegram mints file
  links per session, so its install button opens the post in Telegram — the only way to get the file
  — while a post that links a direct `.ipa` installs normally like any other source. Only a public
  channel's recent posts are readable; private channels have no preview.

### Added
- **Any repository format.** `SourceParser` reads AltStore / SideStore / AltStore PAL / SpotC,
  GBox, Scarlet (both the store shape and its category map), and bare E-Sign / Feather-style
  arrays, with aliases for the fields they name differently (`bundleID`, `down`, `icon`, `dev`,
  `sourceImage`) and sizes written as text (`"12.4 MB"`). A source's apps no longer depend on it
  being AltStore-shaped.

### Changed
- **Source scans are cached, so opening the app doesn't refresh anything.** Each source's parsed
  rows are written to a small index file; the app reads those on launch (no network, no parsing)
  and only refreshes a source that is missing or over six hours old. A refresh is conditional —
  `If-None-Match` — so an unchanged repository costs a 304 with no body and no re-parse.

### Fixed
- **Sources whose apps disappeared now list them.** A source is read field by field instead of
  through one typed schema: the v1 sources (CyPwn and friends) keep their only release at the app's
  top level, and a single field of an unexpected type used to make the whole document unreadable —
  209 apps in, nothing out. Verified against CyPwn (209/209), AppTesters (9,882/9,882), AltStore
  (6/6) and Quark (8/8), and checked in CI by `source-parser`, which decodes live documents through
  the app's own models and fails if an app is dropped.

### Added
- **A repository market, every entry checked.** 33 sources across six groups, each one fetched
  during development and confirmed to return an AltStore-format document (or, for the six GitHub
  rows, releases with `.ipa` assets): AltStore, SideStore, SideStore Team Picks, BatSign, App Fair,
  Taurine; AltStore Complete, Quantum Source and ++, AppTesters, CyPwn; UTM, Provenance, iSH,
  Flycast, Odyssey, Apollo, OatmealDome, Ignited; six community sources; and GitHub release feeds for
  SideStore, LiveContainer, UTM, PPSSPP, Provenance and Delta. The dead entries (E-Sign's old
  `appstore.json`, AppDB, iOS Haven) are gone — Sources now open with a curated list of popular repositories — big
  catalogues (AppTesters, CyPwn, AppDB, iOS Haven), official ones (AltStore, E-Sign, FrizzleM's), and
  GitHub release feeds (SideStore, LiveContainer, UTM, PPSSPP, Provenance, Delta) — each added in one
  tap and labelled with the store it comes from.
- **More than one kind of source.** The add sheet recognises AltStore-format JSON from any host, the
  stores' own `altstore://` / `sidestore://` / `esign://` style links, plain website addresses, and
  `github.com/owner/repo`, whose `.ipa` release assets are read as a source of their own.

### Changed
- **My Apps is split into TestFlight and sideloaded.** Sideloaded builds come first — they're the
  ones that expire and need re-signing — with TestFlight below them. A TestFlight build's menu offers
  Open, Info and Delete only: its provisioning is Apple's, so re-signing it here would replace a
  working beta with the wrong kind of build.

### Changed
- **My Apps no longer parses on the main thread.** Even from cache, the tab decoded every
  provisioning profile (a property list inside each CMS blob) and matched them to apps before its
  first frame, then built every row eagerly. That work now runs in a detached task and the list is
  lazy, so the tab draws and fills in rather than freezing.
- **My Apps opens instantly.** It used to connect to the device as soon as the tab appeared — open
  LocalDevVPN, wait for the tunnel, walk a pairing handshake — before showing a single app. The
  inventory is now kept per device, so the page draws the last list immediately and says how old it
  is. A re-read happens on its own only when the link is already open; **Load** and pull-to-refresh
  still do the full read.

### Changed
- **The marketplace's controls live in one filter box.** The top bar is three things: **All apps**,
  a **filter field**, and **Sources**. Typing in the field searches; its menu picks where to search
  — every source, one source by name, a category, or featured — and how to order the result. The
  sideways list of repositories and the bottom category bar are gone.
- **Sources have a manager of their own** (the *Sources* chip opens it): several links pasted at
  once or chosen from a text file, each source's app count, last fetch and any error, refresh one or
  all, remove one (with what it costs), and export the list for another device.

### Changed
- **The marketplace is lighter and fetches faster.** A source is decoded once into the few fields a
  row shows — name, developer, category, icon, releases — and the document itself (descriptions,
  screenshots, news) is never kept, so a ten-thousand-app source costs a fraction of the memory it
  did. Sources fetch in parallel, four at a time, and a refresh sends the cached `ETag` as
  `If-None-Match`, so an unchanged source usually answers 304 and reads no body at all. Cached copies
  are loaded first, so the list is browsable before the network answers.

### Changed
- **Menus load faster**, in three places that were doing far more work than the screen needed:
  - *Marketplace* built its catalogue with a scan per release — quadratic, and a ten-thousand-app
    repository stalled it. The release→source mapping is now indexed in the same pass, the rail's
    counts are computed once instead of filtered per row, and the visible list is filtered and
    sorted when the filter, the search field or the sort changes rather than on every layout pass.
  - *My Apps* looked up each row's refresh job and its newest release by walking every source and
    every installed app, per row, per pass. Both are indexed by bundle ID when the data changes.
  - *App icons* are read from the disk cache first, then fetched over one `app_service` connection
    per forty apps, instead of a fresh connection and handshake for every icon.

### Added
- **Launch with JIT.** My Apps can start an app under the device's debugger: the app is launched
  suspended through DVT process control, the debugger attaches over RSD (which is what grants the
  right to map executable memory), and the session is held open while the app runs — close it, or
  leave SideInstaller, and JIT ends with it. The row and the Info sheet show the session, its
  transcript, and the way to stop it.
- **The marketplace sorts and merges.** One entry per app, with every release from every source
  merged into it; the row's version menu — and the app's page — pick which release to install. The
  list can be ordered by name, newest, oldest or size.

### Fixed
- **App configuration describes the build being installed, not SideInstaller.** It reads the
  downloaded build, else the custom import, else the selected source's copy on disk, and says which
  file it read. Values left over from the build it read before are replaced instead of pinned to
  the wrong app.
- **App icons in My Apps** come from the device (`app_service`), cached on disk, instead of being
  a generic glyph.
- **Re-sign works across teams**: an app installed by another Apple ID, or under a wildcard
  certificate, is signed here and replaced in place, with a one-tap **Re-sign** on each row.

### Fixed
- **A source no longer shows an empty shelf.** The catalogue is de-duplicated by bundle ID so the
  same app doesn't appear twice, but a source's view was filtering that de-duplicated list — so any
  app another source also carried (with a newer release) vanished from this one's shelf. Sources
  now have their own list, and a source that fails to load says why, in its shelf and with a mark in
  the rail, instead of looking empty.

### Changed
- **The marketplace is compact**: single-column rows with the icon, name, developer, category and
  newest version, and an install button on the row, instead of a grid of tall cards.
- **My Apps is its own tab**, next to Install and Marketplace, and **About moved into Settings**.
  Tools keeps Pairing, Certificates, Entitlements, Location, Inspect .ipa and Side by Side.
- **App configuration starts from the build.** Opening it reads the imported `.ipa` and fills in the
  identity, every top-level `Info.plist` key, the profile's entitlements and the extension bundles.
  Tapping a key in the build adds it to the changes, prefilled.
- **The `Info.plist` editor knows Apple's keys**: typing shows completions with what each key does,
  the editor follows the key's type, and enumerated keys (orientations, device family, background
  modes, privacy strings and so on) offer their documented values as pickers.
- **Tweaks and injectors share one card.** A framework can be fetched where one is published —
  ElleKit from its repository, Substitute from its GitHub release — or added from a copy; a tweak's
  dependencies are read from the package's `Depends` and from the libraries it links, so the right
  framework is loaded with it.

### Changed
- **The marketplace has its own tab**, beside Install and Tools, and its left menu is a rail of
  buttons rather than a split view's list: a split view's selection doesn't push anything at
  compact width, which is how an iPhone almost always shows it, so tapping a category did nothing.
  The rail works at every width, shows how many apps each category and source has, and keeps the
  search field across all of them.

### Added
- **Tweaks can be `.deb` packages.** A package is unpacked (ar → gzip → tar), its `DEBIAN/control`
  read for its name, version and dependencies, and only the libraries it installs are taken — a
  rootful or rootless package works, because the layout inside doesn't matter. Filters and
  preference bundles are ignored.
- **Injector frameworks.** ElleKit, CydiaSubstrate, libhooker and Substitute are added from a copy
  the user has (they can't be redistributed here), under App configuration › Injectors. A
  package's `Depends` decides which one is loaded, and it's injected ahead of the tweak. A tweak
  whose injector is missing says so before the install runs.
- **A full IPA configuration toolkit** in Install › Advanced: identity fields filled in from the
  imported build, arbitrary `Info.plist` keys (text, switch, number, list), entitlements written
  into the app's archived entitlements file, per-extension switches plus remove-all, Watch app
  removal, tweaks, and export/import of the whole configuration as JSON.
- **An app manager** on Tools › Sideloaded apps: per-app **Re-sign** (restarts its seven days),
  **Update to <version>** when a configured source carries a newer release, and **Uninstall**
  through `installation_proxy`.
- **A marketplace** on Tools › Marketplace: a left menu of categories (the same ones an AltStore
  source files apps under) and sources, with an App Store-style grid, search across every source,
  one-tap install, and each app's own page behind it.

### Changed
- **A big source no longer freezes the browser.** The app list is built lazily, so only the rows
  on screen exist; each source's apps are sorted once when it loads instead of on every redraw;
  icons come from a small in-memory cache instead of being re-fetched and re-decoded per row; the
  JSON is decoded off the main thread, both when a source is fetched and when its cached copy is
  read at launch. The entrance cascade is capped as well — it used to delay each row by another
  55 ms, so the four-hundredth app in a source stayed invisible for twenty seconds.
- **Importing another .ipa starts the Install screen over.** A new import clears the last run's
  error, its finished card, its progress and its steps, closes the link field and the Advanced
  section, and selects the custom build — the menu is for the app that's about to be installed,
  not the one before it.

### Added
- **App configuration for the custom .ipa**, in Install › Advanced. Before signing, SideInstaller
  can give the build a new bundle ID (with its extensions re-prefixed to match), a new display
  name, version and build number; remove its app extensions or its Watch app; and inject tweaks.
  A tweak is a `.dylib` copied into the app's `Frameworks` folder and loaded by its main
  executable through an added `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` (or `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`), the same mechanism a
  jailbreak tweak uses. The archive is rewritten in place — every file the change doesn't touch is
  copied as its original compressed bytes — and applying the same configuration twice changes
  nothing the second time.
- **A patcher self-test in CI** (`patch-selftest`): builds a small arm64 `.ipa`, applies a rename
  and an injection through `IPAPatch`, and checks the result with `unzip -t`, `plutil` and
  `otool -l`, including that an untouched resource is still byte-identical and that a second pass
  injects nothing.

### Added
- **Sources: browse an AltStore source and install from it.** Tools › Sources takes any
  AltStore-format source link (AltStore's own is suggested) and lists the apps it carries, with
  screenshots and every release the source publishes. Picking one downloads it and installs it
  with the same run as any other build — signed with your Apple ID, no SideStore needed for the
  first install. Sources are cached, so the list opens without a network, and a source that fails
  to refresh says so without losing its last good copy. `sideinstaller://source?url=…` adds one
  from a link.
- **Inspect .ipa: read a build before signing it.** Tools › Inspect .ipa reads an archive in
  place — no unpacking — and reports the bundle ID, version and build, size, file count and
  SHA-256; the minimum iOS from both the plist and the executable's own Mach-O header, supported
  platforms and devices, every architecture, and whether the code is still FairPlay-encrypted;
  the embedded profile and its expiry; and every extension inside. Problems are listed as
  blockers or warnings: an encrypted App Store build, a build that needs a newer iOS, no arm64
  slice, a missing bundle ID, an extension with no profile of its own.
- **A downloaded build is now checked before it's signed.** A link or a source that delivers an
  encrypted App Store copy, a build for a newer iOS, or an archive with no arm64 code is stopped
  with the reason, instead of registering an App ID for something that can't run.

## 1.6.1

### Added
- **SideInstaller is now in Korean.** Pick 한국어 in Settings › Language, or leave it on Auto
  with your iPhone set to Korean. Thanks to [kes158](https://github.com/kes158) for the
  translation (#85), who's now in About › Special thanks.

### Fixed
- **Apple ID sign-in works again after error -80046.** Since 21 October, Apple takes the password
  and the verification code, then refuses to finish signing in (“This action cannot be completed
  at this time”, error -80046) when the anisette data comes from Apple's Android library, which
  most community servers run. SideInstaller now signs in through the servers that run Apple's
  macOS library, starting with “SideStore (New)”, and reports a current Mac through them, as
  SideStore does, instead of the macOS 10.12 they name, which Apple also called too old for some
  accounts (error -23782). Like SideStore's “Reset adi.pb”, the first sign-in through them makes a
  new anisette identity, so Apple asks for your verification code once more. If you're signed in
  already, your saved sign-in keeps working until it expires.
- **SideStore signs in after SideInstaller installs it.** SideStore starts with its on-device
  anisette and auto-rotation on, which now end in -80046 too. After installing SideStore, on its
  own or inside LiveContainer, SideInstaller turns both off and picks “SideStore (New)”, the
  settings SideStore's users got past -80046 with, and puts client info saved for a Windows PC or
  an Android phone back to SideStore's default. If SideStore still can't sign in, use its
  Settings › User Customizations › Reset adi.pb with “Keep header customizations” unticked, then
  sign in again.
- **A code Apple won't text no longer ends the sign-in.** Through the Mac servers, Apple has asked
  for a code by text and then refused to send one. SideInstaller now sends the code to your Apple
  devices instead, and if Apple won't confirm that either, still asks for the code in case one
  arrived.
- **A slow or failing anisette server no longer holds up sign-in.** A server that answers with an
  error is asked twice more, and one that doesn't answer is left after 20 seconds instead of
  waited on, so sign-in moves on to the next Mac server, which uses the same anisette identity and
  doesn't ask for a new code.

### Changed
- **Auto no longer tries the Android anisette servers.** With Auto on, sign-in goes through the
  Mac servers (“SideStore (New)”, “jkcoxson”, “iLoader (Mac ADI)”, StikStore's, and jkcoxson's and
  StikStore's former Windows servers, which now run Apple's macOS library), then
  “SideStore (Windows ADI)”. If you last signed in through an Android server, it's still tried
  first for your saved sign-in, without your password being sent. With an Android server picked
  in Settings, sign-in now stops and says to choose Auto or a Mac server.
- **“iLoader (Mac ADI)” is on the anisette server list**, the server iLoader's sign-in library
  uses since 22 October. “jkcoxson (Windows ADI)” and “StikStore (Windows ADI)” are now listed as
  Mac servers, which they've become.

## 1.6.0

### Added
- **SideInstaller is ready for the iPhone Duo.** It's built with the iOS 27.1 SDK, so it fills both
  of the Duo's screens rather than running in a window beside the status bar, and resizes with it as
  the Duo opens and closes. On the open Duo's wide screen, and on an iPad, each page keeps to a
  column in the middle instead of stretching every card across the screen. On its side (the closed
  Duo stood up like a tent, or any iPhone in landscape) each page's header takes a single row, so
  what's under it stays in view.
- **SideInstaller asks where it came from before your Apple ID goes in.** The first time you add an
  Apple ID, at setup or later in Settings, it asks whether you downloaded it from sideinstaller.net.
  It's open source, so anyone can publish a copy changed to steal the Apple ID typed into it; “No,
  or I'm not sure” says not to sign in with that copy and links to sideinstaller.net, with a small
  “I understand the risks” below for anyone who wants to go on anyway.
- **The install keeps going when you leave SideInstaller.** On iOS 26 and later it runs as a
  background task: switch apps or lock your iPhone and it carries on, with its step and percentage
  in the Dynamic Island and on the Lock Screen, where you can also stop it. Below iOS 26, a Live
  Activity shows the same for the half minute or so iOS gives SideInstaller in the background; when
  that runs out it says the install is paused, and it carries on once SideInstaller is open again.
  Neither starts while your iPhone pairs, since the pairing code has the Dynamic Island then.
- **The Dynamic Island says when the install needs you, or stopped.** A 2FA code, the App IDs a
  custom .ipa costs, a VPN or Wi-Fi to connect, or a Trust prompt to answer turns SideInstaller's
  Live Activity orange, with what's needed and what to do; an error turns it red, with the reason,
  and it stays up until you're back in the app. Either one opens the Dynamic Island, or drops down
  as a banner on an iPhone without one. On iOS 26 and later, where iOS draws the install's progress
  itself, its title says the same, and SideInstaller's own activity comes up beside it when you
  leave the app while the install needs you: iOS lets an app start one only until it has left the
  screen.
- **SideInstaller can sign with SideStore's certificate instead of competing with it.** A free
  Apple ID gets one development certificate, so when SideStore had made it, SideInstaller stopped
  on “A certificate already exists” and the only way on was revoking it, which stopped every app
  SideStore had signed. With SideStore on the iPhone, that popup now offers “Use SideStore's
  certificate” first: SideStore asks whether to export its certificate
  (`sidestore://certificate`), sends it back, and SideInstaller signs with it from then on and
  retries the install, with nothing revoked. The Certificates page has the same button. The
  certificate is used only once Apple lists it among the signed-in Apple ID's certificates, and the
  key SideInstaller signed with before is kept. SideStore 0.6.4 and the nightlies send it
  unencrypted, and the encrypted one an older SideStore kept works too.
- **The Certificates page exports the certificate SideInstaller signs with.** The certificate it
  signs with is marked “SideInstaller signs with this one” and has an Export button, which asks for
  a password and saves the certificate with its private key as a .p12 file, to save in Files, send
  by AirDrop or open in another signing app. The other certificates can't be exported: their
  private keys stay on the device that asked Apple for them. The file is triple-DES encrypted with
  a SHA-1 MAC, the format Keychain, OpenSSL and iOS signing apps all read.
- **Settings can show Developer Mode, or turn it on.** A new Developer Mode section asks this iPhone
  to show the Developer Mode switch under Settings › Privacy & Security, or to turn Developer Mode
  on, which restarts the iPhone and asks to confirm once it's unlocked. It first checks whether
  Developer Mode is already on, so it never restarts an iPhone for nothing. iOS turns it on from
  here only when the iPhone has no passcode; with one, show the switch and turn it on in Settings.
  Both need a link to the iPhone that already works, such as an imported pairing file on iOS 17.4
  to 26, and below iOS 26.4, when the tunnel won't open, a pairing file made on a computer is tried
  straight through lockdownd. On iOS 27 the link itself needs Developer Mode, so this can't bring
  back a missing switch there (issue #29).
- **`sideinstaller://` links.** `sideinstaller://install?url=<link to an .ipa>` downloads that IPA
  as the custom .ipa and installs it, so a site or a post can offer a one-tap install.
  `sideinstaller://pairingFile?data=<base64>` imports a pairing file, which is what SideStore sends
  back when asked with `sidestore://pairing?urlname=sideinstaller`. On iOS 18 to 26 the Pairing
  file card has a new “Get it from SideStore” button that asks it, so the pairing file SideStore
  already has comes over in one tap. Neither link does anything until you confirm: the popup shows
  the link's address and what it would replace, or the pairing file's UDID. A link that comes in
  during an install asks once the install ends. Links used to be ignored.
- **A custom .ipa shows its App ID cost before it's signed.** Signing registers an App ID for the
  app unless the Apple ID has it already, and a free Apple ID can register only 10 a week. After
  sign-in, the install now stops on a popup showing the new App ID it needs, how many the Apple
  ID has left now, and how many will be left afterwards, then waits for Install or Cancel. When too
  few are left, it says so, shows when the next one frees up, and offers only Cancel, since signing
  would fail anyway.
- **Report a problem.** Under About, in Settings next to the activity log, and on the popup when
  an install stops. It asks what happened (an issue can't be sent empty), shows what goes along
  (SideInstaller's version, iOS, the iPhone model, the app being installed, the step that failed
  and its error), and opens a GitHub issue with all of that filled in. The redacted activity log
  and crash logs go into a report file saved in Files › On My iPhone › SideInstaller › Reports,
  which the issue says to attach; Share the report sends the same file elsewhere. SideInstaller's
  own crashes come from MetricKit, which hands them over the next time it opens. Crash logs from
  SideStore, LiveContainer and Madeira are read from this iPhone over LocalDevVPN, the newest
  three each from the last 30 days, with the device's crash reporter key and vendor ID taken out.
  Each crash log can be left out.
- **The update banner offers three ways to update.** “Get the latest version” now opens a menu:
  from sideinstaller.net, as before; signed with your Apple ID, where SideInstaller downloads the
  latest release and installs it like a custom .ipa (App ID cost popup included); or, with
  LiveContainer on the iPhone, in LiveContainer, which downloads the release and installs it
  inside itself (`livecontainer://install`), asking first before it replaces a copy already there.
  Signing adds your team ID to the bundle ID, so the Apple ID copy installs next to the website's
  build rather than over it.
- **Location spoofing has saved places and GPX routes**, ported from StikDebug. Save under the map
  keeps the spot under the pin with a name, and tapping a saved place sets it straight away. Import
  a .gpx file and the device moves along its track (or route, or waypoints) on the map, as recorded
  when the file has timestamps, or walking, cycling or driving. A new point goes out every half
  second, a progress bar shows how far it has got, Stop here holds the current point, and at the
  end the device stays on the last one.
- **Location spoofing plans routes over OpenStreetMap and drives them at each street's speed
  limit.** Add stops with Add stop under the map (or Add as stop on a saved place), pick Drive,
  Cycle or Walk, and Find route plans a route through them in order, from where the device is when
  it's already simulating. FOSSGIS's public Valhalla server plans it from OpenStreetMap data and
  gives each road's mapped speed limit. A drive goes along every road at its limit (130 km/h where
  there's none, as on parts of the Autobahn); a road with no limit mapped takes the one mapped on
  the rest of the same street or, failing that, a cautious usual limit for its kind of road, and
  the route says how much of it has mapped limits. While it plays, a sign shows the current road's
  limit as it's posted there, in km/h or mph. Walking and cycling go at Valhalla's pace for each
  street. One route is on the map at a time, so planning one removes a GPX route and the other way
  round.

### Fixed
- **Proxy VPNs that loop the device's address back to this iPhone now work instead of
  LocalDevVPN.** ClashMi, Shadowrocket and similar apps can send the Device IP straight back to
  the iPhone with a direct rule, but since they carry all of the iPhone's traffic, SideInstaller
  didn't count them as the tunnel: Install waited for it forever, the Pairing and Location pages
  stayed greyed out, and with “Start LocalDevVPN when needed” on it opened LocalDevVPN, which
  turned the proxy VPN off (issues #30 and #83). With one of these VPNs on, SideInstaller now
  checks whether the device answers at the Device IP, which takes half a second at most, and
  carries on when it does. Nothing changes with LocalDevVPN.
- **A Device IP copied from LocalDevVPN's main screen no longer fails with “Operation not
  permitted”.** LocalDevVPN's main screen says “Connected to 10.7.1.1/32”, but that's this
  iPhone's own end of the tunnel; the address to connect to is the 10.7.0.1 under its Settings ›
  Device IP. iOS won't let an app connect to the iPhone's own addresses, so with 10.7.1.1 in
  Device IP every connection failed at once: with a raw “Socket(Os { code: 1, kind:
  PermissionDenied })” error for an imported pairing file, or with a wrong “The device rejected
  this pairing file” for one this iPhone made. Install already caught this, but the Pairing,
  Apps and Location pages, crash reports and Developer Mode went straight to the connection. All
  of them now check first, and when the tunnel carries 10.7.0.1 SideInstaller switches back to it
  and carries on; otherwise it says which address to use. A connection iOS refuses for any other
  reason now says so in plain words instead of the raw error, and no longer makes an iOS 27
  iPhone pair again.
- **A lockdown pairing file on iOS 26.4 or later now says what to do instead of failing with
  “Broken pipe”.** Since iOS 26.4, the iPhone hangs up on lockdown pairing files (jitterbugpair's,
  “pymobiledevice3 lockdown pair”'s, or idevice_pair's “Lockdown”) as soon as they connect through
  LocalDevVPN, so the link stopped with a raw “Socket(Os { code: 32, kind: BrokenPipe })” error,
  and a new file of the same kind failed the same way. SideInstaller now says so and shows how to
  make a remote pairing file with idevice_pair, which still connects; SideStore, StikDebug and
  LiveContainer moved to these for the same reason. From iOS 26.4 the import guide asks for one,
  and iLoader's exported pairing file, which holds both kinds, works too. A file with both now
  tries its remote pairing record first there, and SideInstaller no longer asks lockdownd for a
  pairing record of its own, or for Developer Mode, through LocalDevVPN, which can't work. On
  iOS 27, Install still pairs the iPhone with itself when the file is lockdown-only, and the
  other pages now say to.
- **Pairing works when SideInstaller runs inside LiveContainer.** Before pairing, SideInstaller
  checks Local Network access by looking for a Bonjour service of its own. Inside LiveContainer,
  iOS only allows the service types listed by LiveContainer, and SideInstaller's wasn't one of
  them, so the check always failed and pairing stopped at “Local Network denied” even with access
  turned on for LiveContainer (issue #38). The check now uses StikPair's service type, which
  LiveContainer lists.
- **Inside LiveContainer, SideInstaller no longer says LocalDevVPN isn't installed.** iOS only
  lets an app ask whether another app is installed for the apps its Info.plist names, and inside
  LiveContainer that's LiveContainer's list, which has SideStore and LiveContainer but not
  LocalDevVPN. So the answer was always no: Settings said LocalDevVPN wasn't installed, “Start
  LocalDevVPN now” stayed greyed out, and Install asked for the tunnel instead of starting it
  (issue #69). Where iOS won't answer, SideInstaller now just opens LocalDevVPN and goes by
  whether that worked. It shows the same note in Settings, and the usual “Connect LocalDevVPN”
  steps during an install, when nothing opens.
- **Side by Side forgets the other iPhone once SideInstaller is on it.** Pairings with other
  people's iPhones were kept for good, so the iPhone that helped could still reach a friend's long
  after. They're now deleted after a successful install, and “Clear their details” deletes them
  too, along with the address. While one is kept, a note under that button says so.
- **Side by Side's IP field has a dot key.** It used a number pad whose separator is a comma in
  many regions, so an address could only be pasted in (issue #54). It now uses the keyboard of the
  Device IP field in Settings.
- **Dates and units follow the app's language on Automatic.** With the language left on
  Automatic, SideInstaller formatted them in English with the iPhone's region, so an iPhone in
  Italian showed Italian text next to English month and unit names. They now use the language the
  text is in, still with the iPhone's region.
- **A failed Apple ID sign-in shows the error that explains it, not just the last one.** With Auto
  on, sign-in tries the anisette servers one after another, and the error it ended with was the
  last server's. That was almost always one of the Mac servers, which are tried last: one that was
  down (issue #82), or Apple answering “A Mac with macOS version 10.13 or later is required”
  (issue #89). It now shows Apple's answer about your account if there was one, and otherwise
  Apple turning down the computer a server reports before a server that was down, with the name of
  the server it came through. That macOS answer now also skips the other Mac servers, since they
  all report the same Mac, and the message counts only the servers tried, saying how many were
  skipped, instead of “all 20”.

### Changed
- **Madeira now comes from a GitHub release.** Latest installs Madeira from the releases of
  [FrizzleM/Madeira](https://github.com/FrizzleM/Madeira), the build that renews its own signing,
  instead of a fixed download link, and Advanced lists that fork's releases. Upstream releases
  come back once upstream Madeira renews its own signing.
- **The anisette server can be left on Auto, or kept to one.** Settings › Anisette Server has a new
  Auto choice, the default, which works as sign-in did before: it starts with the server that last
  signed in, then tries the others, the ones most likely to work first. It now also remembers a
  server that failed by itself in the last 12 hours and tries it after the others of its kind.
  Picking a server, or a custom URL, now means only that one is tried: if it fails, sign-in stops
  with the error and suggests choosing Auto. Before, a picked server was only the first of all of
  them.
- **Side by Side doesn't need the other iPhone's IP address.** Leave the field empty and their
  iPhone pairs from its Settings straight away. SideInstaller reaches it at the address it paired
  from and fills that in, so a retry after a failed step uses the same pairing. A typed address
  works as before, and if their iPhone pairs from a different one, that one is used.
- **“StikStore (Mac ADI)” is on the anisette server list**, as in iLoader 2.3.10. It's a Mac
  server like “jkcoxson” and “SideStore (New)”, shares their anisette identity, and is tried with
  them, last. iLoader now starts on “SideStore (New)”, but its users still report the code being
  asked for by text and then refused, so SideInstaller keeps starting on the Windows servers.
- **App extensions no longer use up App IDs.** SideInstaller signs an app's extensions with the
  app's own provisioning profile, yet it still registered an App ID for each of them that nothing
  used, out of the 10 a free Apple ID gets a week. Now only the app gets one, as in iLoader 2.4.0:
  SideStore with its widget costs 1 App ID instead of 2, and signing sends fewer requests to Apple.
- **The update banner goes by the latest release.** SideInstaller now checks the version tag of the
  newest release on GitHub instead of a separate version file, so the banner shows up as soon as a
  release is out. Betas don't trigger it.

## 1.5.3

### Fixed
- **Moving between the two kinds of anisette server no longer breaks sign-in.** Servers on Apple's
  Android library and on its Windows library can't use each other's anisette identity, and
  SideInstaller kept only one, so when a server went down and sign-in moved on, every server of the
  other kind failed. SideInstaller now keeps one identity for each kind and remembers which one each
  server takes, so it can move back and forth without making a new identity, which Apple would ask
  for your verification code again. A server that changes kind is followed the same way.

### Changed
- **New sign-ins start on a Windows anisette server.** A first sign-in now goes through
  “jkcoxson (Windows ADI)”, where SideInstaller's Windows PC matches the machine the anisette data
  comes from. Through the Android servers it only passes as long as Apple lets it. If you have
  signed in before, SideInstaller stays on the server you used, keeping your saved sign-in. When
  that server fails, the Windows servers are tried next, and “StikStore (Windows ADI)” is added to
  the list for that.
- **The Mac anisette servers are tried last.** “jkcoxson” and “SideStore (New)” make their data
  with Apple's macOS library, and SideInstaller signs in through them as the Mac they name and
  keeps a separate anisette identity for them. Through them Apple has asked an account with trusted
  devices for a code by text and then refused to send one, so they come after every other server
  rather than first, where iLoader 2.3.9 puts them.
- **Apple turning away one kind of device no longer ends sign-in.** Through the Mac servers
  SideInstaller signs in as a Mac, and through the others as a Windows PC. When Apple refuses one
  of them twice (HTTP 503), the servers left that sign in as it are skipped and the others are
  tried, instead of sign-in stopping after the second refusal.
- **The anisette server decides what device SideInstaller signs in as**, when it names a device of
  its own, as the Windows servers do. Servers that still name the old Mac, which Apple refuses,
  get the Windows PC. A server that moves to another of Apple's libraries then works without an
  update.
- **Sign-in reports the same device from start to finish.** The verification-code requests, which
  SideInstaller sent as a Mac since 1.5.1, now go as the Windows PC like the rest, since Apple
  accepts them from it. If Apple turns them away, they go as a Mac again.
- **LocalDevVPN starts when it's needed, not when SideInstaller opens.** The setting is now
  “Start LocalDevVPN when needed”, and your choice carries over. With it on, opening SideInstaller
  no longer sends you to LocalDevVPN. Installing, scanning or writing on the Pairing page, loading
  or refreshing on the Apps page, and setting a location start it when the tunnel is off, then carry
  on once you're back. Opening the Apps or Location page uses the tunnel only if it's already up.

## 1.5.2

### Fixed
- **Signing in works again.** Apple now turns away the Android device SideInstaller has signed in
  as since 1.5.0, and sign-in stopped with “Apple's sign-in server refused the request (HTTP 503)”.
  SideInstaller now signs in as a Windows PC, which Apple accepts through the same anisette servers.
  The anisette identity SideInstaller already saved keeps working.
- **The Windows anisette servers work.** “SideStore (Windows ADI)” and “jkcoxson (Windows ADI)” in
  the server list make their data with Apple's Windows library. Sign-in through them failed while
  the anisette identity was being set up, since SideInstaller didn't say it was a Windows PC, and
  Apple asks each new identity on them to resync once before it signs in. SideInstaller now does
  both.
- **A mistyped Apple ID is reported at the first server.** Apple now answers an Apple ID it doesn't
  know with a new error code, which SideInstaller tried on every anisette server in turn before
  giving up. It now says the Apple ID or password is incorrect straight away, as it did before.

## 1.5.1

### Fixed
- **A verification code by text or phone call works again.** Since 1.5.0 signs in as an Android
  device, Apple turned away the requests that list your trusted phone numbers and send a code to
  one, so the code prompt had no number to offer and the code could only come from a trusted device.
  Asking for a new code on your devices failed the same way and ended the sign-in. Those requests
  are made the way Apple accepts them again: your numbers are back in the prompt, with a text or a
  call to each, and a new code can be sent to your devices.
- **An Apple Account with an unverified email address is told so.** Apple won't let such an account
  use developer services (error 2160), and SideInstaller took that for a stale sign-in: it signed in
  again with the password on each anisette server in turn, about every 8 seconds, before giving up
  with a raw error. It now stops at the first refusal, keeps the saved sign-in, and shows how to
  verify the address at account.apple.com. Certificates, Entitlements and Side by Side stop the same
  way.

## 1.5.0

### Changed
- **The Install button grows into the progress card.** Starting an install reshapes the button into
  the card that shows its steps, instead of turning it into a Cancel button under a separate card.
  After an install that finished or failed the card stays and the button comes back under it, as
  before.
- **Stopping an install asks first.** The progress card has an X in its corner, and tapping it asks
  “Cancel the install?” before anything stops. While the step in flight winds down the card reads
  “Cancelling”, then it shrinks back into the Install button.
- Advanced steps aside while an install runs, since a run can't take a change to the version or the
  pairing file. It comes back under the Install button once the install finishes, fails or is
  cancelled, as open or closed as you left it.
- **Cards are clear glass.** Every card is now a clear pane the animated backdrop shows through,
  drawn by a rim lit along its top edge, in place of the gray cards. It looks the same on every iOS
  version.
- The new text is translated into Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish and
  Vietnamese.

### Fixed
- **Signing in to your Apple ID works again.** Since 12 October 2026 Apple has turned away sign-ins
  made through the public anisette servers (error -80045, “This action cannot be completed at this
  time”). Apple now refuses a sign-in that doesn't come from the kind of device the anisette data
  was made on: those servers make it with Apple's Android library, and SideInstaller said it was a
  Mac. It now signs in as the Android device the data belongs to. After your password, Apple sends a
  verification code to your trusted devices straight away, and SideInstaller asks for it.

## 1.4.0

### Added
- **Madeira joins the Install picker.** [Madeira](https://github.com/willfaust/Madeira) runs Windows
  PC games on an iPhone. SideInstaller signs it with the Increased Memory Limit entitlement it needs
  (Madeira shows it as Memory+), and puts your iPhone's pairing inside it, so Madeira's built-in JIT
  is set up without pairing again or importing a file: in its setup, “In-app with pairing file”
  already shows as done. Madeira needs iOS 26 or later; on an older iOS the install stops before it
  uses up an App ID. It reads only the pairing iOS 27 makes on the iPhone itself, or an imported
  file with the same kind of record. A file with only a classic lockdown record isn't passed on.
  Until upstream Madeira renews its own signing, Latest installs a fixed build that does; a version
  picked under Advanced comes from Madeira's GitHub releases. Madeira has no nightly, so the
  Stable/Nightly picker is hidden for it.
- **Madeira renews its own signing.** SideInstaller hands Madeira the sign-in it needs for that: the
  developer-service token this sign-in got and the anisette identity that goes with it, the same
  things SideStore keeps to refresh. Your Apple ID password isn't included, and no 2FA code is
  needed. Madeira moves it into its Keychain on first launch and from then on asks Apple for a new
  profile and installs it itself, whenever it's open with LocalDevVPN connected, so it keeps working
  with SideInstaller uninstalled. It needs SideInstaller again only when Apple stops accepting the
  token (it has an expiry, and a password change ends it): installing Madeira again hands over a
  new one. Only Madeira builds that say they take the sign-in get one; older ones are refreshed
  under Tools › Sideloaded apps. Madeira is signed without an app group, since the App ID it
  registers again each week comes without one.
- Madeira joins the apps the Pairing tab can hand the pairing file to.
- **The pairing code follows you into Settings.** While your iPhone pairs, SideInstaller now runs a
  Live Activity. When Settings asks for the code, it appears in the Dynamic Island, or drops down as
  a banner on an iPhone without one, and stays on the Lock Screen, so you no longer have to switch
  back to SideInstaller to read it. Once the pairing goes through it says so, and a tap takes you
  back to the app. A build signed with a certificate that can't sign app extensions sends the code
  as a notification instead, and asks to allow notifications the first time you pair; builds with
  the Live Activity never ask. Installed through SideStore, AltStore or Xcode with a free Apple ID,
  SideInstaller now takes two App IDs instead of one, since the extension that draws the Live
  Activity needs its own.
- **Crypto donations.** About › Crypto shows a wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, one at a
  time, each with its network, a QR code and a Copy button. Donations are optional and don't unlock
  anything.

### Changed
- **Most of the app is already on your iPhone by the time signing finishes.** Signing only changes a
  few of an app's files, so the rest is copied over from the download while signing runs, and only
  the changed files are sent afterwards. Every file copied early is checked against the signed app
  before installing.
- If the install needs you to tap Trust for the pairing file, it now asks right after connecting, so
  you can answer while everything else runs, instead of at the very end.
- When SideStore or LiveContainer is already installed, the pairing file goes in while the app is
  being signed rather than after the install. Together, reinstalling SideStore on an iPhone 16 now
  takes about 8.5 seconds, down from about 11 in 1.3.1.
- If Apple asks for a 2FA code while your iPhone is asking you to tap Trust, SideInstaller's code
  prompt now waits until you've answered.
- **LiveContainer + SideStore comes from LiveContainer's own repository again.** Since 1.3.0 it came
  from a copy on LiveContainerMirror/LiveContainer, whatever file was there. GitHub has hidden
  LiveContainer's organization since 4 October 2026, so while the repository is gone SideInstaller
  still takes LiveContainer's last nightly (18 September 2026) from that copy, but only that exact
  file: it's checked against the SHA-256 of the official build, and anything else under that link is
  refused. Stable and Nightly both install that build for now. Once the repository is back,
  SideInstaller goes back to it by itself, Stable included.
- **SideInstaller installs on iOS 17.4 and later**, down from iOS 18. As on iOS 18 to 26, an iPhone
  below iOS 27 needs a pairing file made on a computer.
- Everything new is translated into Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish and
  Vietnamese.

### Fixed
- **A download whose connection drops is tried again.** The download runs while the VPN comes up,
  which can cut a transfer already going, and the install then stopped with “couldn't reach GitHub:
  The network connection was lost.” SideInstaller now tries twice more, a second and three seconds
  later, before it gives up.
- **A build whose GitHub repository is gone says so.** When there's no copy to fall back on, the
  install no longer stops with a bare 404, which reads like a fault on your side. SideInstaller says
  the repository is unavailable and that your iPhone and network are fine, and shows how to install
  from an IPA you got elsewhere: name it as shown and copy it into Files › On My iPhone ›
  SideInstaller.
- An app that looks its background task up in its own Info.plist, taking the first entry of a kind,
  now finds the one under the bundle ID it was signed with. SideInstaller listed those after the
  originals, so such an app asked iOS for a task it wasn't allowed and lost its background work.
  Madeira's Steam downloads rely on this to carry on in the background.
- Stopping an install while it signs in to your Apple ID no longer leaves a 2FA prompt to pop up
  later. The sign-in carried on behind the stopped install; a code request from it is now turned
  down.
- Files left in the iPhone's staging folder by an interrupted install are cleared before the next
  upload, so they can no longer end up inside the app being installed.

## 1.3.1

### Added
- **AltStore Classic installed as a custom IPA comes with your pairing.** AltStore 2.3 can install
  and refresh apps without a computer through a Remote AltServer, but setting that up asks you to
  pair with a PC first. SideInstaller now puts your iPhone's pairing inside AltStore when it signs
  it, encrypted the way AltServer does it, so after you sign in to AltStore the setup skips that
  step. This works with the pairing SideInstaller creates on the iPhone itself on iOS 27, and with
  an imported pairing file that includes the same kind of record. A file with only a classic
  lockdown record isn't passed on, since AltStore can't connect with it. The pairing stays on your
  iPhone.

### Fixed
- **SideStore's home screen widget shows your apps.** The widget looks for SideStore's app group in
  its own settings, and SideInstaller only wrote the group into the app's, so the widget opened an
  empty list. It now gets the group too, as AltServer does and as iLoader 2.3.6 does. This affects
  SideStore 0.7.0-alpha and older; nightlies find the group another way.
- **AltStore Classic installed as a custom IPA knows which iPhone it's on.** AltStore reads the
  iPhone's UDID from its own settings, where AltServer writes it during installation. SideInstaller
  left in whatever UDID the IPA came with, so AltStore registered that device with your Apple ID and
  signed apps for it instead. It now gets the UDID of the iPhone it's installed on.
- An imported app that schedules background work under its own bundle ID, such as a long export
  with iOS's continued processing tasks, can run it again after signing. Signing adds your team ID
  to the bundle ID, and iOS only runs those tasks under the bundle ID the app now has. Each such
  task is now allowed under the new bundle ID too, and still under the old one for apps that name it
  directly. Reported to iLoader in issue #649.

## 1.3.0

### Changed
- **Signing uses apple-codesign-quick**, the signer iLoader moved to in 2.3.0. It hashes an app's
  files and signs its extensions and frameworks in parallel. In tests on a Mac it signed SideStore
  about 6 times faster and LiveContainer + SideStore about 9 times faster, and SideInstaller itself
  is about 5 MB smaller. An imported IPA that still carries leftovers of an old signature inside its
  `_CodeSignature` folder is signed cleanly as well.
- **Popups that appear together are merged into one card.** The pairing code and its Settings steps
  are one popup, an error and the steps to fix it are one, and the “Installed” message, the trust
  step and LiveContainer's certificate import are one “Success: last steps” popup.
- When Apple briefly turns a sign-in away as too many requests (HTTP 429), SideInstaller now tries
  again twice, a few seconds apart, before saying Apple is limiting sign-ins. iLoader found these
  often clear up straight away.

### Fixed
- LiveContainer + SideStore downloads again while LiveContainer's GitHub repository is down: it
  comes from a temporary mirror, which only has the nightly build, so Stable installs that too.
- **An imported IPA whose name has symbols, spaces or non-Latin letters signs again.** Apple refuses
  to register an App ID under such a name (error 35), so signing stopped before it started.
  SideInstaller now registers it under the name's letters and digits only, as iLoader does.
- When two people each pair the same iPhone with Side by Side, the second no longer undoes the
  first. Every SideInstaller used to pair under one shared identifier, and an iPhone keeps a single
  pairing per identifier; each install now pairs under its own. Pairings already remembered keep
  working.
- The Certificates tool can revoke “Apple Development” certificates, the ones Xcode makes, instead
  of failing with error 7252.
- AutoFill fills in the Apple ID and password together on the sign-in page, instead of one at a
  time.

### Added
- Three more problems now get their own explanation and steps instead of a raw error: an Apple
  Account Apple won't let sign apps because of its owner's age (error 1102), an Apple ID out of App
  IDs for the week (error 9120), and an iPhone that already has the three apps a free Apple ID may
  install. The age refusal also stops sign-in at once rather than trying every anisette server.
- PanicAnalyzer joins the apps the Pairing tab can hand the pairing file to.

## 1.2.2

### Changed
- The app behind a popup is now dimmed further as well as blurred, in light mode too, until the
  popup closes.
- On iOS 27, handing the pairing file to another app no longer tries to add a classic lockdown
  pairing first. iOS 27 refuses that every time, so the attempt only cost time and left a warning
  in the log. The file carries the pairing that StikDebug and SideStore nightlies from 20 September
  2026 on read. Older SideStore builds, LiveContainer's built-in SideStore and Feather need a
  classic pairing, which iOS 27 doesn't allow these apps to use on the iPhone itself.

### Fixed
- **SideStore Nightly no longer asks you to import the pairing file.** Nightlies from 20 September
  2026 on stopped reading the pairing file where SideInstaller put it: they look for one file per
  connection type under new names, turn down a file that holds both, and only load one after their
  own import has saved two settings. SideInstaller now writes the pairing that way too, and sets
  those settings the way SideStore's import does, so SideStore connects on first launch. Older
  SideStore builds and LiveContainer + SideStore keep getting the file they read.

## 1.2.1

### Changed
- **The log is safe to share.** It leaves out your Apple ID, your iPhone's name, serial numbers,
  IMEI, SIM and subscriber numbers, network hardware addresses, Find My data and pairing keys, and
  shortens the UDID to its first and last characters. Model, iOS version, errors and connection
  details stay, and errors now say why a request couldn't be sent (DNS, connection or TLS).
- Closing a popup that a running install is waiting on, such as the pairing code or the steps to
  connect LocalDevVPN, now asks first, since it ends the install.

### Fixed
- **Sign-in says when SideInstaller can't reach Apple.** It used to try every anisette server and
  blame them, although none was at fault. It now stops and says why: Cellular Data turned off for
  SideInstaller, Wi-Fi not allowed for it, no internet connection, a disconnected VPN holding traffic
  back, or something on the network blocking Apple.

## 1.2.0

### Added
- **Advanced options on the Install tab.** Pick which version of SideStore or LiveContainer +
  SideStore to install, and import a pairing file by hand on iOS 27 as well (#60).

### Changed
- Messages are shown as popups, so they're harder to miss.
- Switching between pages is smoother.

## 1.1.0

### Changed
- **Installing SideStore or LiveContainer + SideStore is faster.** The download now starts as soon
  as the network is up and runs while your iPhone pairs, connects and signs in to your Apple ID,
  instead of waiting for all of that to finish first.
- Signing in to your Apple ID now happens while SideInstaller opens its link to your iPhone, rather
  than after it.
- An IPA downloaded on an earlier run is reused when GitHub still serves that exact file, so trying
  again after a failed install, or installing the same build later, skips the download.
- SideStore's certificate hand-off is prepared while the app installs, and finding the installed app
  afterwards only asks your iPhone about the apps you installed, not every system app.
- **Signing asks Apple for everything it needs at once.** Registering your iPhone, finding the
  certificate, and setting up the App IDs and app group now go out together instead of one after
  another, so signing SideStore takes under 3 seconds instead of over 6.
- Signing in with a saved Apple ID session makes two fewer requests to Apple.
- The signed app reaches your iPhone over several connections at once, which shaves a little more
  off the install. Together, a SideStore install on an iPhone 16 went from about 18.5 seconds to
  about 11.

### Fixed
- **Side by Side works with iPhones on iOS 27.** Their iPhone dropped the connection the moment
  SideInstaller asked it to pair (error 54), before any Trust prompt could appear, so every run
  stopped at the first step. iOS 27 only pairs over Wi-Fi from its own Settings, so Side by Side now
  switches to that: it shows what to do on their iPhone — Settings › Privacy & Security › Developer
  Mode, then “Pair with SideInstaller (Side by Side)” — and the code to type there, and carries on
  once they have. The pairing is remembered for that address, so installing again doesn't ask for it.
- Pairing someone else's iPhone this way leaves this iPhone's own pairing file alone, and uses a name
  of its own, so it can't break the pairing their own SideInstaller sets up for itself.
- Cancel stops Side by Side straight away while it waits for their iPhone to pair.
- Tapping Stop while the IPA downloads now stops the install, instead of carrying on with an older
  copy of the IPA left in Documents.

## 1.0.0

### Added
- **A Tools tab.** It holds Side by Side, which installs SideInstaller on another iPhone or iPad
  wirelessly; the Certificates and Pairing tools; a location spoofer; and an entitlement manager,
  mainly for adding the Increased Memory Limit.
- **iPhones on iOS 18 to 26 can use SideInstaller**, if they already have a pairing file, which
  takes a computer to make. The Pairing tool needs iOS 27.
- 2FA codes can come by SMS or phone call.
- Import .ipa takes a URL as well as a file.
- A dark and a glass app icon.
- Portuguese, and Japanese (thanks to @so-5699).
- SideInstaller starts LocalDevVPN at launch.

### Changed
- Apple ID sessions are saved and reused, so Apple rate-limits sign-ins less often.
- The progress bar looks better.
- SideInstaller needs approving in Privacy & Security less often.

### Fixed
- **No more "Import Account" box on first launch.** Recent SideStore builds — including the one
  inside LiveContainer + SideStore nightly — stopped importing the certificate hand-off on their
  own and started asking for a *file password* instead. They only accept a file encrypted by
  SideStore's own Export Account, never delete the one they find, and only remember it once a
  password has worked, so the box came back every single launch and could never be dismissed for
  good. SideInstaller now checks the SideStore build it just signed and skips the hand-off entirely
  when that build would ask, exactly as iLoader does. Builds that still import it quietly — SideStore
  stable, and LiveContainer + SideStore stable — are unaffected and keep the certificate as before.
  On the builds that ask, SideStore offers to resign itself on first sign-in instead, which is the
  normal flow and takes one tap.
- **LiveContainer + SideStore installs again on the Nightly setting.** LiveContainer's nightly
  release stopped carrying the combined `LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa` — it now publishes the plain
  LiveContainer build alone, which has no SideStore inside it — so picking Nightly for that app
  simply failed to download. SideInstaller now looks through LiveContainer's other releases, takes
  the newest one that still has the combined build, and says in the log which release it used.
  Asking for Stable is never answered with a nightly. This also covers SideStore if its releases
  ever move the same way.
- Sign-in no longer fails with HTTP 503.
- SideInstaller works with LocalDevVPN's latest update again.
- Import .ipa lets you pick a file again.
- An anisette server picked in Settings stays picked.

## 0.9.0

### Fixed
- SideStore, LiveContainer + SideStore and Feather now accept the pairing file SideInstaller puts in
  them, instead of asking you for one as though nothing had been placed.
- SideInstaller now switches on the setting those apps need to reach your iPhone over your local
  tunnel, which nothing was doing before.
- The install may ask you to unlock your iPhone and tap Trust once; it remembers the result and
  won't ask again for that device.
- If that extra step doesn't work, your install still finishes exactly as it did before, and the log
  says what went out.

### Added
- **SideStore is handed the certificate it was installed with.** SideStore only signs with a
  certificate it holds the private key for, and the one SideInstaller installs it with lives here,
  not there. On a free Apple ID — one certificate, no room for a second — SideStore's first sign-in
  therefore revoked ours, issued its own, and put up *Resign SideStore*, asking to reinstall itself
  before it would refresh. The install now seeds `Account.sideconf` into SideStore's container in
  the same step that writes the pairing file, over the same tunnel: SideStore imports the
  certificate on first launch, deletes the file, and carries on with the certificate it already has.
  No revoke, no reinstall, nothing for you to do. Your Apple ID password is deliberately not
  included — it isn't needed to keep the certificate, and the file is plain JSON until SideStore
  reads it. Reinstalling over a SideStore you had already set up replaces its stored account, so
  you'll enter your Apple ID password there once more. Building the file only ever reads the
  certificate: it can't create one, so it can't revoke one either, and a failure is logged and
  skipped rather than failing an install that is otherwise complete.
- One button in the Pairing tab now writes the pairing file into every supported app it found, and
  one app refusing it no longer stops the rest.
- Export now shares the pairing file that every app can read, so importing it by hand works as well
  as letting SideInstaller place it.

## 0.8.0

### Fixed
- **Recent SideStore nightlies launch again.** They refuse to start unless every app extension inside
  the bundle carries its own provisioning profile, and SideStore ships a widget. Signing wrote the
  profile into the app but never into the widget, so the app died on the splash screen behind a
  misleading Core Data error — *“Can't add the same store twice”* — that came back on every Retry. The
  widget now gets the profile it is signed against, and the same fix covers any other IPA with
  extensions. The signature was always correct; only the file was missing.
- **A busy GitHub no longer stops the install, or sends you off to sideload by hand.** The SideStore
  download went through api.github.com, whose 60-requests-an-hour limit is counted per public IP — so
  behind carrier-grade NAT the quota can be spent by strangers before SideInstaller asks for anything.
  GitHub said so plainly, but the reply's status was never looked at: its body went to the release
  decoder and came out as “Key 'tag_name' not found”, under a hint about GitHub being unreachable that
  cost people ten minutes of manual work to get around a wait that clears itself. The IPA now comes off
  GitHub's ordinary download link, which isn't rate-limited at all; the API is asked only if an asset
  has been renamed. When something does go wrong the reasons stay apart — out of reach, refused (with
  how long the wait is, when it's a limit), or an answer that wasn't a release — and the *fetch it
  elsewhere and copy it in* hint appears only where that's genuinely the way past it.
- **A download that isn't an IPA is caught when it arrives.** The status of the download itself was
  logged but never checked, so a block page or a transfer that stopped partway was filed in Documents
  under the name that had been asked for, and only found out much later as an unexplained signing
  failure. A download now gets the same check an imported file has had since 0.7.0.

### Changed
- Dependencies updated; see `v0.8-dependency-updates.txt`.

## 0.7.0

### Added
- **Custom .ipa.** A third option in the Install picker, alongside SideStore and LiveContainer +
  SideStore. Choosing it swaps the Stable/Nightly control for an **Import .ipa** button that opens the
  Files picker — pick any IPA, from iCloud Drive, a USB drive, anywhere — and SideInstaller signs and
  installs that instead of downloading. The button then shows the filename, so the card always says
  which IPA will be installed. The pairing-file step still runs and seeds AltStore-family apps, but no
  longer fails the install for an IPA that doesn't want one.
- **Install from an IPA you supply yourself.** SideInstaller's Documents folder is now visible in
  **Files › On My iPhone › SideInstaller**. Drop a `SideStore.ipa` (or `LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa`,
  optionally `-nightly`) in there and the install uses that file instead of downloading anything — the
  way through for anyone who can't reach GitHub. Imported files are listed under Settings › Downloaded
  IPAs marked *imported*; deleting one goes back to downloading. A download that fails now also falls
  back to a copy left by an earlier run rather than stopping the install.

### Changed
- **Any loopback VPN works, not just LocalDevVPN.** The tunnel check always tested the device subnet
  rather than which app provided it, but the copy said otherwise. It now names LocalDevVPN and ClashMi
  as examples and points out why the choice matters: iOS runs one VPN at a time, so a local-only tunnel
  leaves nothing to download SideStore through where GitHub is blocked.
- **Importing no longer freezes the app.** The copy runs in the background and the button says
  *Importing…* while it does. It used to happen inline, which is fine off local storage and not at all
  fine off the two sources the instructions recommend — iCloud Drive and a USB drive — where a
  hundred-megabyte read takes long enough for iOS to kill the app for being unresponsive.
- **A file picked from iCloud Drive imports.** The copy is now file-coordinated and asks for the
  download first, so an item that hasn't been pulled down yet is waited for rather than failing.
- **A failed import leaves the previous one alone.** The picked file is copied and checked in a staging
  folder, and only replaces what's loaded once it's known good. Before, the old import was deleted
  first, so a full disk — or simply picking the wrong file — destroyed it and left the button still
  showing its name.
- **A half-copied IPA is caught at import instead of at signing.** The check read the first two bytes,
  which a truncated archive still passes; it now also looks for the zip's end-of-central-directory
  record, which only a complete file has.

### Fixed
- **The Pairing tab no longer fails with “adapter closed” after sitting idle.** It reused the device
  link on the strength of a check that only proves our handles aren't null — but iOS tears the tunnel
  down underneath them, so scanning or writing minutes later hit a dead link. It now re-establishes
  first, the same way the install step has since 0.6.5.
- **A reconfigured tunnel is detected properly.** LocalDevVPN lets you change its tunnel IP, device IP
  and subnet mask; SideInstaller assumed a /24 and would report “no loopback VPN” for a working tunnel
  on any other mask. It now reads the interface's real netmask and asks the question that actually
  matters — would traffic to this address go into that tunnel?
- **A tunnel is no longer confused with a home network on the same range.** The check matched any
  interface in the target's subnet, so a Wi-Fi LAN on `10.7.0.x` read as a connected tunnel. It now
  has to be a tunnel interface *and* carry the address.
- **Putting the wrong address in Device IP is caught immediately.** LocalDevVPN's main screen shows
  `10.7.0.0` — its own end of the tunnel — while the address to connect to is the `10.7.0.1` under its
  Settings › Device IP. Entering the first left a tunnel that read as up and a run that failed at
  Connect after a sign-in and a download. SideInstaller now recognises an address this iPhone already
  holds and says so before starting.
- **Wi-Fi is only required for the step that needs it.** The tunnel is a loopback — it routes its own
  subnet and excludes the default route — so it works fine on cellular, and so does everything else in
  the run. Only pairing needs the local network, to be findable by Settings. With a pairing file
  already saved, installing no longer demands Wi-Fi; nor do the Pairing tab's scan and write.
- **The pairing file and your signing certificate are no longer sitting in a folder anyone can browse.**
  Making the Documents folder visible in Files — the point of the import feature — exposed everything
  in it, including the device pairing record and isideload's storage, which holds the developer
  certificate. Both moved to Application Support, which file sharing doesn't reach; existing copies are
  migrated on first launch, so nobody has to pair again. Documents is now only the IPA drop-zone.
- **A custom IPA named `SideStore.ipa` no longer breaks SideStore updates.** Downloads were tracked by
  filename alone, so an import sharing a name with a download shared its entry — and deleting the
  import erased the download's claim. The app then read its own downloaded copy as user-supplied and
  stopped ever refreshing it from GitHub. Tracking is now per-path.
- **The tunnel/Wi-Fi poll no longer redraws the whole UI twice a second.** It republished its state
  every 2 seconds whether or not anything had changed, which invalidated every view watching it for as
  long as the app was open.
- **Installing a large build no longer risks being killed for memory.** Each file of the signed bundle
  was read into memory whole before being uploaded a megabyte at a time; it's now mapped.

## 0.6.5

### Fixed
- **One-click install no longer fails at the final step after a slow sign-in or download.** The device tunnel opened during Connect was held and reused for the install, but it sat idle through Apple ID sign-in (2FA), the SideStore download, and signing — often 1–2 minutes. iOS tears down an idle tunnel, so the install would stop with `⛔️ … "adapter closed" (NetworkUnreachable)` when it tried to reach the AFC service. The installer now refreshes the device link (a quick re-pair-verify, no PIN) right before uploading, so install and the pairing-file write always run over a live tunnel. Runs with a fast sign-in/download were unaffected, which is why this only showed up intermittently.
